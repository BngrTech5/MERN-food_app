# MERN-food_app

GoFood - MERN Stack Project

Developed a full-stack web application for online food ordering using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). Implemented secure user authentication with JWT, a responsive UI with React and Bootstrap, and a RESTful API for backend operations. Managed state using React and ensured dynamic UI adjustments based on user authentication status.
